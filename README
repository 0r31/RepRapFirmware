This firmware is intended to be a fully object-oriented highly modular control p
rogram for 
RepRap self-replicating 3D printers.

It owes a lot to Marlin and to the original RepRap FiveD_GCode.

General design principles:

  * Control by RepRap G Codes.  These are taken to be machine independent, thoug
h some may be unsupported.
  * Full use of C++ OO techniques,
  * Make classes hide their data,
  * Make everything as stateless as possible,
  * No use of conditional compilation except for #include guards - if you need t
hat, you should be
       forking the repository to make a new branch - let the repository take the
 strain,
  * Concentration of all machine-dependent defintions and code in Platform.h and
 Platform.cpp,
  * No specials for (X,Y) or (Z) - all movement is 3-dimensional,
  * Try to be efficient in memory use, but this is not critical,
  * Labour hard to be efficient in time use, and this is  critical,
  * Don't abhor floats - they work fast enough if you're clever,
  * Don't avoid arrays and structs/classes,
  * Don't avoid pointers,
  * Use operator and function overloading where appropriate, particulary for vec
tor algebra.
